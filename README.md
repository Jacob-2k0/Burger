### How it works:

This project is a full stack application that allows you to place an order for a burger then devour it.
Upon placing an order, your burger of choice will be displayed in the lower left card titled "Burgers".
All burgers in that card are equipped with a "Devour Me" button for you to 'eat' the burger.
After devouring a burger it gets moved to the "Devoured Burgers" card where you can throw out your leftovers.
